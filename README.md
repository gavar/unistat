UniStat
=========
Unity 4+ C# Framework


What started out as a collection of classes and third party scripts copied from one project to another, eventually turned into a useful little framework that I thought should be shared with the wider Unity community.

I find this collection of scripts essential for all my new games and saves a lot of time, I hope that others find it useful :)

Please contact me if you wish to help make this better! No, really, because it's pretty terrible. I will gladly give collaborator to anyone with good ideas and a passion for Unity/C#.

PLEASE NOTE: UniStat is built to work with NGUI pretty closely, but if you don't use NGUI, you can delete the "DataBinding" folder as well as LoadingScene and still use the rest of the features.

Features
=====
* Generic data model: Keep all your game data in one place, whatever it may be (List, String, Dictionary or anything), persist it between scenes and save the game state perfectly to disk every time.
* NGUI Bindings: Bind a UILabel to your data model and it will automatically update when the model does.
* Scene-Mode-View or "SMV" design pattern (c)2013 Me
* Library of stuff I need often, ie. ColorHSV, Perlin & Simplex Noise Generators, Random name generators etc.
* Tested on PC, Mac, Linux and iOS. Cannot promise Android until I test it ;)
